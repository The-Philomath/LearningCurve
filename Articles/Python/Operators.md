## About

What are different types of operators in python?

`arithmetic operators:` + - * % /

`relational operators:`  < <= > >=  ==  !=

`assignment operator` ( ++ and -- are not allowed in python )
```python
val=10
val+=10  (or) val = val + 10
val-=10  (or) val = val -10
```

`logical operators`
```python
and       if a>10 and 1<100
          if len(name) == 10   and name.isupper():

or        if color == "red"  or color == "black":
              #logic

not       if not name.isupper():
              #logic
```

`special operators`
```python
in      if "python" in name:
            print("exist")          
is      if  name is None
as      # used in exception handling
```
