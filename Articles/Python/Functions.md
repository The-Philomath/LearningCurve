## About

In Python if we talk about methods it means we are talking about member methods i.e. we are talking about methods of an object.

If we are talking about functions it means we are talking about functions common for all the objects.

**Bulitin functions**
```python
print() # print to console
input() # capture input from keyboard
range() # define a range like range(1,10) shows number from 1...9
len() # length of object
isinstance() # Returns True if a specified object is an instance of a specified object
type() # type of object
id() # Returns the id of an object
help() # Executes the built-in help system
dir() # The dir() function returns all properties and methods of the specified object, without the values.
sum() # Sums the items of an iterator
max() # returns the item with the highest value, or the item with the highest value in an iterable.
min() # returns the item with the minimum value, or the item with the minimum value in an iterable.
zip() # Returns an iterator, from two or more iterators
map() # Returns the specified iterator with the specified function applied to each item
filter() # Use a filter function to exclude items in an iterable object
```

**typecasting functions**
```python
str()
int()
list()
float()
oct()
hex()
tuple()
dict()
