// Sample Output:-
    Detected memory leaks!
    Dumping objects ->
    {73} normal block at 0x006260F8, 4 bytes long.
     Data: <    > 03 00 00 00
    Object dump complete.
    
This shows that memory block number 73 address 0x006260F8 had allocated a memory of 4 bytes.
03 is stored at first byte as my system is little endian.
This memory got leaked.
