## About
Basics of dynamic programming confuses sometimes. lets make them clear.

In Top Down approach we break down the problem in subsets in a recursive function and get the solutions when recursion unwind.

In Bottom Up approach we start with a small problem and solve it. Next time we will take a bigger problem and solve that with help of previous solutions. Its an iterative approach unlike Top Down which is a recursive approach.
