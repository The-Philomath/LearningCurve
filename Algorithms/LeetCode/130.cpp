/**********************************************************************************
*
*    Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
*
*    A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
*
*    Example:
*
*    X X X X
*    X O O X
*    X X O X
*    X O X X
*    After running your function, the board should be:
*
*    X X X X
*    X X X X
*    X X X X
*    X O X X
*    Explanation:
*
*    Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
*    Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
*    Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
